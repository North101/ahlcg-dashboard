## Running the code

Requires [badger_ui](https://github.com/North101/badger_ui) framework

This code is designed to work for the [Badger2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040) but with some small tweaks it could work for the [Pico Inky Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-inky-pack) (though this only has 3 buttons).

## Update Investigator Data

To update the investigator data run:

```bash
python3 arkhamdb.py
```
